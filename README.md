Data collection was conducted from January 23 to March 6, 2023 using **Tweepy** library in Python. 
A total of 9801 tweets were collected on the specified date.


For sentiment analysis, the **VADER** model was used. 
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and simple rule-based model that is well-suited for sentiment analysis on social media platforms. 
It can effectively handle various expressions used on social media platforms, such as vocabularies, abbreviations, capitalizations, repeated punctuations, and emoticons, to determine sentiment.

The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer module in the **NLTK** library of Python was used for the model.

The result generated by VADER is a dictionary of 4 keys, including neg, neu, pos, and compound. 
The keys neg, neu, and pos represent negative, neutral, and positive sentiments, respectively, and their sum should be equal to 1 or close to it using float operation.
The table below outlines the methodology used to determine the exact emotion of the text using the VADER sentiment analysis tool:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Positive</th><th>Negative</th><th>Neutral</th><th>Emotion</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Happy</td></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>Curious</td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>Neutral</td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>Upset</td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>Angry</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

The table presents a logical structure for mapping the resulting sentiment scores from VADER into the corresponding emotions. 
The resulting sentiment scores of 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral' are mapped into the emotions 'happy', 'curious', 'neutral',  'upset', and 'angry', respectively.

The frequency of famous accounts was determined based on their followers, which were obtained from the user's profile information. 
Hashtags were counted in the collected tweets to identify popular discussions on the platform. 
The locations of the tweets were identified by extracting information from the user's profile bio, which provided details about their geographical location. 
By analyzing these features, we gained a deeper understanding of the sentiment and behaviors of Twitter users about the shocking news of Missed Baby.
